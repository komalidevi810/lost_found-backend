# 🎯 Lost & Found Hub

A web platform designed to help college students **report and recover lost or found items** with ease.  
Instead of spreading messages through word of mouth, this system allows users to post details of lost or found items and connect directly with others.

---

## 💡 Project Inspiration
In colleges, students often lose belongings such as earphones, ID cards, or books and have no centralized way to find them.  
This project aims to solve that problem by providing a **simple digital hub** where students can list lost or found items, verify claims, and communicate securely.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🔔 **Instant notifications** when new items are listed  
- ✅ **Response validation** to prevent false claims or misuse  
- 📂 **Track your listings and responses** in one place  
- 💬 **User-friendly interface** — easy to navigate for all students
